Conclusions that are drawn from the various stemmers that we have used.
Conclusion 1:
In both the stemmer(LANCASTER & PORTER)  the words that are ending with e are not correctly predicted.
For Ex:
stemmerporter.stem('troubling'): troubl
stemmerlancaster.stem('Troubling'): troubl

Conclusion 2:
Also, both the stemmers dont take into consideration the prefixes and correctly predict the words. but the extend is different in both.
For Ex:
stemmerporter.stem('disadvantage'): disadvantag
stemmerlancaster.stem('disadvantage'): disadv
Reason: Due to the change in the meaning of the words.

Conclusion 3:
In Lancaster stemmer the case of the letters doesnâ€™t matter, whereas in porter stemmer the case of the letters in a word helps in correctly identifying the stem of the given word
For Ex:
stemmerporter.stem('Dying'): dy
stemmerporter.stem('dying'): die
stemmerlancaster.stem('Dying'): dying
stemmerlancaster.stem('dying'): dying
After working with the various types of stemmers, the above stated conclusions were drawn. The conclusions can vary according to people while working with the stemmers.
